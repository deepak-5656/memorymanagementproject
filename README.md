💾 Real-Time Memory Allocation Management
An educational, interactive web-based simulation project that helps visualize how memory is allocated in real time using different allocation strategies—Best Fit and Paging. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s designed to aid students and beginners in understanding OS-level memory management concepts.

🔍 Overview
Operating systems handle memory management using different strategies to allocate memory blocks to processes. This project visualizes those strategies in a user-friendly and interactive format to improve conceptual clarity and allow experimentation.

This is particularly useful for:
👨‍🎓 Computer Science students
💡 Beginners learning Operating Systems
🎓 Academic demonstrations and mini-projects

🧪 Features
📊 Real-Time Memory Visualization
✅ Supports Best Fit Allocation Method
🧱 Paging Simulation with Fixed-size Partitions
🖱️ Dynamic Input for Memory and Process Sizes
🎨 Clean and Responsive UI
💻 No backend or framework dependencies

🧰 Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structuring the application interface
CSS3	Styling and responsive layout
JavaScript	Handling core logic and interactivity
GitHub Pages	Live deployment of the web application
VS Code (optional)	Used as the development environment



📌 Use Cases
📘 Academic demonstrations
🧑‍🏫 Teaching aid for Operating Systems
🧪 Learning simulation for memory management concepts

🛠️ Future Enhancements
🧠 Add more allocation strategies (First Fit, Worst Fit)
📦 Real-time memory deallocation
📊 Graphical analytics of memory usage
🌐 Backend integration for real-time tracking
