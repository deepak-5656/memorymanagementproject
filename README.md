### 🔮 Future Scope  
The current version of the Real-Time Memory Allocation Management project lays the foundation for visualizing how memory is handled within an operating system.  
However, there are several exciting improvements and features that can be added to enhance its functionality and learning potential:

- 🔁 **Additional Allocation Strategies**: Extend support to include *First Fit*, *Worst Fit*, and *Next Fit* memory allocation methods for broader conceptual coverage.  
- 🧹 **Memory Deallocation Simulation**: Allow processes to terminate and return memory blocks back to the pool, simulating real-life scenarios more closely.  
- 📉 **Performance Analysis Metrics**: Display real-time statistics such as fragmentation level, memory utilization percentage, and average access time.  
- ⚙️ **Dynamic Paging and Segmentation**: Add support for segmentation-based memory management with dynamic segment creation and access.  
- 🛜 **Backend Integration (Optional Upgrade)**: Connect to a backend server to log, analyze, or compare memory operations historically.  
- 🧠 **AI-Assisted Allocation Advisor**: Introduce basic AI logic that suggests the most efficient allocation technique based on the current memory state.  
- 🌐 **Multi-User Simulation Mode**: Allow collaborative simulation where multiple users can observe or control different processes in real time.  
- 📱 **Mobile Responsiveness and App Version**: Package the simulation as a mobile-friendly web app or a standalone Electron-based desktop app for wider accessibility.
